# Placeholder Profile Picture

Add your profile picture here as `profile.jpg`

The image should be:
- Square aspect ratio (e.g., 500x500px or 1000x1000px)
- Good quality portrait photo
- Professional appearance
- JPG or PNG format

You can also use `profile.png` if you prefer PNG format. Just update the file extension in `src/components/Hero.tsx` if needed.
